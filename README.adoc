= adoc2typ

`adoc2typ` converts an
https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor[AsciiDoc] file to
https://github.com/typst/typst[Typst].

We can then generate PDF from the Typst, and that may be a better
option than existing methods for converting AsciiDoc to PDF.

`adoc2typ` uses Asciidoctor to convert to Docbook, and
https://pandoc.org[Pandoc] to convert Docbook to Typst, with some
bash and batch-vi processing in the interstices.

== Install

Put the scripts `adoc2typ`, `adoc2docbook`, `docbook2typ` in your
`PATH`.

== Usage

  adoc2typ sample.adoc

produces `sample.typ`.

A file `.typstrc.typ` from `$TYPST_ROOT` is included at the head
of `sample.typ`. You can either have this be an empty file or put
in it whatever Typst macros you prefer.

To convert the generated `sample.typ` to PDF:

  typst c sample.typ

You may find that you need to spot-check `sample.typ` for stray
spacing issues.

Adoc files may include other adoc subfiles, images, math. The
extension need not be `.adoc`.
